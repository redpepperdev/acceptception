            <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the server is located, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. The parties agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be filed only in the state or federal courts located in said jurisdiction and they hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. If any provision of this Agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. This is the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter herein and shall not be modified except in writing, signed by both parties. The failure of either party to enforce any right or provision in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by such party in writing. In the event that any action, suit, or proceeding is instituted to enforce any provision of this Agreement, the prevailing party in such dispute shall be entitled to recover from the losing party all fees, costs, and expenses of enforcing any right of such prevailing party under or with respect to this Agreement, including without limitation, such reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys and accountants, which shall include, without limitation, all fees, costs, and expenses of appeals. This Agreement is personal to you and is not assignable, transferable, or sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer, or delegate any of our rights and obligations hereunder without consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of this Agreement and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries required or permitted to be provided hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given and effective on the earliest of: (a) the date of transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered via electronic mail at the email address specified in this Agreement, or (b) the date of receipt, if such notice or communication is delivered personally or by courier, or (c) three (3) business days after deposit in the United States mail, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid. The headings of the paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute part of this Agreement or to affect the construction thereof. The failure to exercise any right provided in this Agreement shall not be a waiver of prior or subsequent rights. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of a) your use and access of the Service, by you or any person using your account and password; b) a breach of these Terms, or c) Content posted on the Service. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of a) your use and access of the Service, by you or any person using your account and password; or b) a breach of these Terms. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms and your use of the Service. The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of performance. The Company its subsidiaries, affiliates, and its licensors do not warrant that a) the Service will function uninterrupted, secure or available at any particular time or location; b) any errors or defects will be corrected; c) the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components; or d) the results of using the Service will meet your requirements. This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by the Company without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void. The terms of this Agreement are severable. If any term or provision is declared invalid or unenforceable, that term or provision will be construed consistent with applicable law as nearly as possible to reflect the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining terms of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Company and governs your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and the Company. You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content, or third-party software. The parties are independent contractors. This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the parties. Each party will be solely responsible for payment of all compensation owed to its employees, as well as all employment-related taxes. The language of this Agreement is English. Where the Company has provided a translation of the English version of this Agreement, you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with the Company. If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence. The waiver of any right or provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of the Company. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under this Agreement will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this Agreement or otherwise. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. The section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. This Agreement operates to the fullest extent permissible by law. If any provision of this Agreement is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision is deemed severable from this Agreement and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The Companyâ€™s failure to enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding the Service. We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service. This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales. Each party irrevocably agrees that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims). Any waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by the Company. The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You agree that your relationship with the Company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. This Agreement is for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, the parties only. This Agreement is not intended to confer any right or benefit on any third party. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind the Company in any respect whatsoever. The Company may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the terms and conditions, by email, regular mail, or postings on the service. You may not use the service if you are a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. You agree to comply with all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable content. You agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the country in which you reside. Your use of the service is at your sole risk. The service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. The service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of performance. The Company does not warrant that the service will meet your specific requirements, that the service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free, that the results that may be obtained from the use of the service will be accurate or reliable, that the quality of any products, services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by you through the service will meet your expectations, and that any errors in the service will be corrected. Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the service is done at your own discretion and risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the download of any such material. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from the Company or through or from the service shall create any warranty not expressly stated in the terms. The Company reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that the Company shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the service. The above limitations may not apply to you. In such cases, the liability of the Company will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. You agree that this Agreement and your use of the Service are governed under the law of the specified jurisdiction. We each agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the specified county. The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. The parties have required that this Agreement and all documents relating thereto be drawn up in English. This Agreement was last modified on the date specified at the top of this document. The Company may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time. You are solely responsible for ensuring that these Terms are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to you and the right to access the Service is revoked where these Terms or use of the Service is prohibited or to the extent offering, sale or provision of the Service conflicts with any applicable law, rule or regulation. Further, the Service is offered only for your use, and not for the use or benefit of any third party. The Company will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section. You may not use your account to breach the security of another account or attempt to gain unauthorized access to another network or server. Not all areas of the Service may be available to you or other authorized users of the Service. You shall not interfere with anyone elseâ€™s use and enjoyment of the Service. Users who violate systems or network security may incur criminal or civil liability. You agree that we may at any time, and at our sole discretion, terminate your membership, account, or other affiliation with our site without prior notice to you for violating any of the above provisions. In addition, you acknowledge that we will cooperate fully with investigations of violations of systems or network security at other sites, including cooperating with law enforcement authorities in investigating suspected criminal violations. You and the Company agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Service must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. The foregoing is the entire agreement between you and the Company regarding the Service. The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect. The parties are independent contractors and no agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. Your comments and suggestions are welcome. All comments, feedback, information, or materials, which you submit to the Company, shall be considered non-confidential and the Companyâ€™s property. By submitting such comments, feedback, information or materials to the Company, you agree to a no-charge assignment to the Company of all worldwide rights, title and interest in copyrights and other intellectual property rights to the comments, feedback, information or materials. The Company shall be free to use, copy, or distribute such comments, feedback, information, or materials on an unrestricted basis without accounting to you. The service may provide, or third parties may provide, links to other World Wide Web sites or resources. Because the Company has no control over such sites and resources, you acknowledge and agree that the Company is not responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such sites or resources. You further acknowledge and agree that the Company shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such site or resource. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement. The Companyâ€™s performance of this Agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in this Agreement is in derogation of the Companyâ€™s right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Service or information provided to or gathered by the Company with respect to such use. A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. This Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and merges all prior discussions between the parties with respect to such subject matter. The language of this Agreement shall be interpreted as to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any party. Any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not apply in interpreting this Agreement. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not be used to interpret or construe the provisions of this Agreement. The use of the word "including" in this Agreement shall be by way of example rather than by limitation. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The official language of this Agreement is English. If there is a conflict between the English language version and any translation, the English language version will control. All dealings, correspondence and contacts between us shall be made or conducted in the English language. The provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision may be removed and the remaining provisions will be enforced. This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by the Company without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of this Agreement shall be void. The relationship of the parties is that of independent contractors. Neither party is agent for the other, and has no authority to bind the other to any third-party contracts. This Agreement will be binding on, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Neither the course of conduct between parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of this Agreement. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved. The Company may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our website, as determined by the Company in our sole discretion. The Company reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users. The Company is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. We recommend that you add our email address to your email address book to help ensure you receive email notifications from us. The Company may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the â€˜last modifiedâ€™ date at the bottom of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service. The Service is controlled and operated from its facilities in the specified country. The Company makes no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the specified country, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the specified country government. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Service are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the specified country. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the specified jurisdiction, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in the specified county for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. If we do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. All claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including its formation, performance and breach), the partiesâ€™ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the specified arbitration association, in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the specified arbitration association, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitratorâ€™s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement shall be subject to the specified Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and the Company may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. You and the Company agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Company and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. You and the Company agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or the Companyâ€™s intellectual property rights; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The parties agree that for any disputes not subject to arbitration, such dispute shall be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the specified county. The Companyâ€™s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of this Agreement. The Company may assign its rights and duties under this Agreement to any party at any time without notice to you. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved. This Agreement is effective until terminated by either party. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying all materials obtained from any and all Company site(s) and all related documentation and all copies and installations thereof, whether made under the terms of this Agreement or otherwise. This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from the Company if in the Companyâ€™s sole discretion you fail to comply with any term or provision of this Agreement. Upon termination, you must destroy all materials obtained from this site and all copies thereof, whether made under the terms of this Agreement or otherwise. The provisions of this Agreement, which by their nature should survive your termination of this Agreement, shall be deemed to survive such termination. The Company makes no representation that materials in the site are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who choose to access this site from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. Software from this site is further subject to United States export controls. No software from this site may be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported (i) into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods; or (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders. By downloading or using the software, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such country or on any such list. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the specified jurisdiction, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. If any provision of this Agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. This is the entire agreement between us relating to the subject matter herein and shall not be modified except in writing, signed by both parties. The Companyâ€™s licensors shall be third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, you must comply with all applicable U.S. and non-U.S. export control laws. The Company may deliver notice to you under this Agreement by means of electronic mail, a general notice on the Service, or by written communication delivered by first class U.S. mail to your address on record in the Companyâ€™s account information. You may give notice to the Company at any time via electronic mail to the specified email address or by letter delivered by first class postage prepaid U.S. mail or overnight courier to the specified address. All notices shall be deemed given and effective on the day of transmission. The Company will not be in default or otherwise liable for any delay in or failure of its performance under this Agreement if such delay or failure arises by any reason beyond its reasonable control, including any act of God, any acts of the common enemy, the elements, earthquakes, floods, fires, epidemics, riots, failures or delays in transportation or communications, or any act or failure to act by the other party or such other partyâ€™s employees, agents, or contractors. The parties are independent contractors and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as creating an employer-employee relationship, a partnership, or a joint venture between the parties. Each party will be responsible for its own costs and expenses in its performance of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be assigned by you without the prior written consent of the Company. The Company may assign this Agreement to any affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of its assets or voting securities. Any attempt to assign or transfer this Agreement in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. The section headings in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or substantive effect. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of any subsequent breach of the same or any other provision of this Agreement. This Agreement represents the entire understanding between the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, with respect to such subject matter. The language of this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language mutually chosen by the parties and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against either party. The parties acknowledge that they have had an opportunity to review this Agreement with legal counsel of their choice. If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, it will not impact any other provision of this Agreement, all of which will remain in full force and effect. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid and enforceable provision that achieves the original intent of the parties. This Agreement is intended to be the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties. The parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. All waivers must be in writing. The failure of a party to require performance of any provision will not affect that partyâ€™s right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by a party of a breach of any provision be a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same provision or a waiver of any other provision. The Company shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond the Companyâ€™s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation. These Terms of Service are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations hereunder without consent. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of these Terms of Service and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under these Terms of Service, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneysâ€™ fees. We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce these Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users and the public. The Company does not guarantee that the Service will be free from bugs, security breaches, or from virus attacks. The Service may occasionally be unavailable for routine maintenance, upgrading, or other reasons. You agree that the Company will not be held responsible for any consequences to you or any third party that may result from technical problems of the internet, slow connections, traffic congestion or overload of our or other servers. We do not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any product or service advertised or offered by a third party through the Service or any hyperlinked website or service. This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and the Company. It supersedes and replaces any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between the Company and you regarding the Service. The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. This Agreement operates to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign our rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign any of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without our prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is void and ineffective. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to waive any and all rights to a trial by jury in connection with any dispute arising out of or in any way related to this Agreement. The parties agree that the prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees. This Agreement is not intended to and does not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties. You agree that we may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to this Agreement, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Service. The Company shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law. The parties have expressly requested that this Agreement be drawn up in English. The original English version of this Agreement may have been translated into other languages. In the event of any inconsistency or discrepancy between the English version and any other language version, the English language version shall prevail. The parties agree that any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be applied in the construction or interpretation of this Agreement. The Companyâ€™s acceptance of your application to use the Service is expressly conditioned upon your assent to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to the exclusion of all other terms.
