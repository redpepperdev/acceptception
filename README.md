# ðŸ’¥ ACCEPTCEPTION.JS ðŸ’¥

**Tired of cookie banners? So are we.**

Do you have eyes and use the internet? Then you've felt the pain. The endless, soul-crushing, mind-numbing tyranny of the cookie consent banner! A "solution" so elegant, so user-friendly, it could only have been designed by a committee of bureaucrats with a deep-seated hatred for the internet.

We've had enough. The cookie accept must end.

## The Solution

`acceptception.js` is our answer. It's a weapon of malicious compliance, designed to give the regulators a taste of their own medicine. This script will unleash an endless barrage of pop-ups, impossible-to-click buttons, and absurdly long terms of service on the very people who brought this plague upon us. It's about sending a message.

## How It Works

The script is simple. It detects if a user is visiting from an IP address associated with a European regulatory body and, if so, unleashes the chaos. For everyone else, it does nothing.

## Join the Resistance

1.  Add `acceptception.js` to your website.
2.  Include this script tag:
    ```html
    <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redpepperdev/acceptception/main/acceptception.js" async></script>
    ```
3.  Watch the fun begin.

**Disclaimer:** This is satire. Or is it?
